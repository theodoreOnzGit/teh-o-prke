= Feedback Mechanism Readme 


= Theory 

From Lamarsh:

Lamarsh, J. R. (1975). Introduction to nuclear engineering.

3rd edition, we refer to chapter 7 page 328 to 330.

There are several feedback mechanisms 

== Short term feedback (seconds to minutes)

1. Delayed Neutrons 
2. Fuel Temperature Feedback
3. Void/Density feedback of moderator, fuel and reflector 
4. Control Rod feedback
5. Leakage feedback

I hope to make this general as possible, even with molten salt breeder 
reactors (MSBRs) such as the liquid fluoride thorium reactor (LFTR) in  
future. But for now, start with solid fuel first.


== Medium term feedback (1-2 days)

6. Reactor poison feedback 
7. Burnable poison/absorber feedback 

These would include soluble boron, Xe-135 or iodine pit and samarium 
poisoning.

== Long term feedback (3 days to several months)

8. Fuel depletion
9. Fuel breeding
